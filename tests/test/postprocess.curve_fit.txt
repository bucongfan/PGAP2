The pan-genome is open. The pan-genome is open, meaning that the discovery of new genes will continue as more genomes are added.
The coefficient k is approximately 4015.77, indicating the initial addition rate of new gene clusters per genome.
Larger values of k suggest a higher initial rate of gene discovery.
